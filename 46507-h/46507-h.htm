<h4>CAPTAIN HINDE</h4>
<p class="book">THE FALL OF THE CONGO ARABS. By <span class="sc">Sidney L.
Hinde</span>. With Portraits and Plans. <i>Demy 8vo. 12s. 6d.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This volume deals with the recent Belgian Expedition to the Upper Congo, which
developed into a war between the State forces and the Arab slave raiders in
Central Africa. Two white men only returned alive from the three years&rsquo; war&mdash;Commandant
Dhanis and the writer of this book, Captain Hinde. During the
greater part of the time spent by Captain Hinde in the Congo he was amongst
cannibal races in little-known regions, and, owing to the peculiar circumstances
of his position, was enabled to see a side of native history shown to few Europeans.
The war terminated in the complete defeat of the Arabs, seventy thousand of
whom perished during the struggle.</p>

<h4>BADEN-POWELL</h4>
<p class="book">SCOUTING SKETCHES IN RHODESIA. By <span class="sc">Lieut.
Colonel Baden-Powell</span>. With numerous Illustrations, Maps,
etc. <i>Demy 8vo. Cloth. 15s.</i></p>
<h4>PRINCE HENRI OF ORLEANS</h4>
<p class="book">FROM TONKIN TO INDIA. By <span class="sc">Prince Henri of
Orleans</span>. Translated by <span class="sc">Hamley Bent</span>, M.A. With over 100
Illustrations and 4 Maps. <i>Demy 8vo. 21s.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The travels of Prince Henri in 1895 from China to the valley of the Bramaputra
covered a distance of 2100 miles, of which 1600 was through absolutely unexplored
country. No fewer than seventeen ranges of mountains were crossed at altitudes
of from 11,000 to 13,000 feet. The journey was made memorable by the discovery
of the sources of the Irrawaddy. To the physical difficulties of the journey were
added dangers from the attacks of savage tribes. The book deals with many of
the burning political problems of the East, and it will be found a most important
contribution to the literature of adventure and discovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>L. DECLE</h4>
<p class="book">THREE YEARS IN SAVAGE AFRICA. By <span class="sc">Lionel Decle</span>.
With an Introduction by <span class="sc">H. M. Stanley</span>, M.P. With 100 Illustrations
and 5 Maps. <i>Demy 8vo. 21s.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Few Europeans have had the same opportunity of studying the barbarous parts of
Africa as Mr. Decle. Starting from the Cape, he visited in succession Bechuanaland,
the Zambesi, Matabeleland and Mashonaland, the Portuguese settlement on
the Zambesi, Nyasaland, Ujiji, the headquarters of the Arabs, German East
Africa, Uganda (where he saw fighting in company with the late Major &lsquo;Roddy&rsquo;
Owen), and British East Africa. In his book he relates his experiences, his
minute observations of native habits and customs, and his views as to the work
done in Africa by the various European Governments, whose operations he was
able to study. The whole journey extended over 7000 miles, and occupied
exactly three years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>H. S. COWPER</h4>
<p class="book">THE HILL OF THE GRACES: <span class="sc">or, the Great Stone
Temples of Tripoli</span>. By <span class="sc">H. S. Cowper</span>, F.S.A. With Maps,
Plans, and 75 Illustrations. <i>Demy 8vo. 10s. 6d.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Turkish prohibition against all European travel in their African Pashalics has,
during the last seventeen years, rendered impossible both geographical and
arch&aelig;ological research. The author, however, was enabled to make two journeys
through the hill range of Tripoli in 1895 and 1896, and this volume deals chiefly
with a remarkable series of megalithic Temples and Trilithons, which he found
to exist there in extraordinary numbers. These ruins have hitherto been quite
uninvestigated, and to Englishmen should have an exceptional interest, from the
light it is believed they will throw on our own national monument of Stonehenge.
In all about one hundred sites were visited and photographed, and the volume will
be fully illustrated by maps, plans, and photographs. Chapters will also be devoted
to modern Tripoli, the little visited ruins of Leptes Magna, the ancient and
modern geography of the district generally, and the author&rsquo;s personal experiences.</p>

Rev. <span class="sc">Morris Fuller</span>, B.D., Vicar of St. Mark&rsquo;s, Marylebone.
<i>Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Davenant, Bishop of Salisbury, the maternal uncle of Dr. Fuller, lived at a very
critical time in our history (1571-1641). He was one of the British representatives
of the first great Synod of the reformed churches held at Dort, was one of Archbishop
Laud&rsquo;s Suffragans, and assisted him in carrying out his reforms.</p>
<p>Pr&eacute;cis is given of some of the Bishop&rsquo;s writings, and a very celebrated sermon, never

<h4>DAVID HANNAY</h4>
<p class="book">A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ROYAL NAVY, <span class="sc">From
Early Times to the Present Day.</span> By <span class="sc">David Hannay</span>.
Illustrated. <i>2 Vols. Demy 8vo. 15s.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book aims at giving an account not only of the fighting we have done at sea,
but of the growth of the service, of the part the Navy has played in the development
of the Empire, and of its inner life. The author has endeavoured to avoid
the mistake of sacrificing the earlier periods of naval history&mdash;the very interesting
wars with Holland in the seventeenth century, for instance, or the American
War of 1779-1783&mdash;to the later struggle with Revolutionary and Imperial France.</p>

8vo. 7s. 6d.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This volume aims at describing the nature of the different armies that have been
formed in Great Britain, and how from the early and feudal levies the present
standing army came to be. The changes in tactics, uniform, and armament are
briefly touched upon, and the campaigns in which the army has shared have
been so far followed as to explain the part played by British regiments in them.</p>

<p class="book"><b>S. Baring Gould.</b> THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
By <span class="sc">S. Baring Gould</span>. With over 450 Illustrations in
the Text and 13 Photogravure Plates. <i>Large quarto. Gilt top. 36s.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;A brilliant and attractive volume. It impresses first by reason of its bulk,
and next by reason of its substantial and striking binding. Within, it is
remarkable, to begin with, for the considerable number and unusual excellence
of its illustrations. Never before, it is safe to say, have so many pictures
relating to Napoleon been brought together within the limits of an English
book. The portraits alone are multitudinous; Bonaparte is presented to us
at all ages, in all sorts of costume, and amid very varied circumstances. Then
there are reproductions of statuettes, busts, and medals, caricatures, portraits of
his connections by birth and marriage, representations of events in which he took
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
part, and what not. The list of illustrations in the text covers nine pages, and in
addition there are a dozen full-page photogravures, in which famous paintings are
reproduced. Altogether, this is a table-book of the first class. But it is more. It
embodies &ldquo;a study of the character and opinions of Napoleon&rdquo; on which Mr.
Baring Gould can be freely congratulated. The writer&rsquo;s plan has been to &ldquo;lay
on one side what concerned Napoleon&rsquo;s military achievements and the political
importance of his life, so far as did not bear on the development of his mind and
the movements of his heart.&rdquo; By this means a novel point of view has been
secured, and the result is a narrative of which the chief characteristic is an agreeable
freshness.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

letters to one person these are arranged together. The first volume contains,
among others, (1) Letters to his father; (2) to his young wife; (3) to his confessor,
Lamennais; (4) a very important set of about fifty letters to Sainte-Beuve; (5)
letters about his early books and plays.</p>

speculations by which he permanently influenced theological and metaphysical
thought; while it will be a surprise to most readers to find him also appearing as
the author of some of the most exquisite religious poetry in the Latin language.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that
may be very generally accepted. His views of life are fresh and vigorous, his
language pointed and characteristic, the incidents of which he makes use are
striking and original, his characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional
people, are drawn and coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his
descriptions of scenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes and skilled
hands of a master of his art, that he is always fresh and never dull, and under
such conditions it is no wonder that readers have gained confidence both in his
power of amusing and satisfying them, and that year by year his popularity
