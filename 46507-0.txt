                             CAPTAIN HINDE

THE FALL OF THE CONGO ARABS. By Sidney L. Hinde. With Portraits and
Plans. _Demy 8vo. 12s. 6d._

  This volume deals with the recent Belgian Expedition to the Upper
  Congo, which developed into a war between the State forces and the
  Arab slave raiders in Central Africa. Two white men only returned
  alive from the three years’ war—Commandant Dhanis and the writer of
  this book, Captain Hinde. During the greater part of the time spent by
  Captain Hinde in the Congo he was amongst cannibal races in
  little-known regions, and, owing to the peculiar circumstances of his
  position, was enabled to see a side of native history shown to few
  Europeans. The war terminated in the complete defeat of the Arabs,
  seventy thousand of whom perished during the struggle.


                              BADEN-POWELL

numerous Illustrations, Maps, etc. _Demy 8vo. Cloth. 15s._


                        PRINCE HENRI OF ORLEANS

FROM TONKIN TO INDIA. By Prince Henri of Orleans. Translated by Hamley
Bent, M.A. With over 100 Illustrations and 4 Maps. _Demy 8vo. 21s._

  The travels of Prince Henri in 1895 from China to the valley of the
  Bramaputra covered a distance of 2100 miles, of which 1600 was through
  absolutely unexplored country. No fewer than seventeen ranges of
  mountains were crossed at altitudes of from 11,000 to 13,000 feet. The
  journey was made memorable by the discovery of the sources of the
  Irrawaddy. To the physical difficulties of the journey were added
  dangers from the attacks of savage tribes. The book deals with many of
  the burning political problems of the East, and it will be found a
  most important contribution to the literature of adventure and
  discovery.


                                L. DECLE

THREE YEARS IN SAVAGE AFRICA. By Lionel Decle. With an Introduction by
H. M. Stanley, M.P. With 100 Illustrations and 5 Maps. _Demy 8vo. 21s._

  Few Europeans have had the same opportunity of studying the barbarous
  parts of Africa as Mr. Decle. Starting from the Cape, he visited in
  succession Bechuanaland, the Zambesi, Matabeleland and Mashonaland,
  the Portuguese settlement on the Zambesi, Nyasaland, Ujiji, the
  headquarters of the Arabs, German East Africa, Uganda (where he saw
  fighting in company with the late Major ‘Roddy’ Owen), and British
  East Africa. In his book he relates his experiences, his minute
  observations of native habits and customs, and his views as to the
  work done in Africa by the various European Governments, whose
  operations he was able to study. The whole journey extended over 7000
  miles, and occupied exactly three years.


                              H. S. COWPER

THE HILL OF THE GRACES: or, the Great Stone Temples of Tripoli. By H. S.
Cowper, F.S.A. With Maps, Plans, and 75 Illustrations. _Demy 8vo. 10s.
6d._

  The Turkish prohibition against all European travel in their African
  Pashalics has, during the last seventeen years, rendered impossible
  both geographical and archæological research. The author, however, was
  enabled to make two journeys through the hill range of Tripoli in 1895
  and 1896, and this volume deals chiefly with a remarkable series of
  megalithic Temples and Trilithons, which he found to exist there in
  extraordinary numbers. These ruins have hitherto been quite
  uninvestigated, and to Englishmen should have an exceptional interest,
  from the light it is believed they will throw on our own national
  monument of Stonehenge. In all about one hundred sites were visited
  and photographed, and the volume will be fully illustrated by maps,
  plans, and photographs. Chapters will also be devoted to modern
  Tripoli, the little visited ruins of Leptes Magna, the ancient and
  modern geography of the district generally, and the author’s personal
  experiences.

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF JOHN DAVENANT, D.D. (1571-1641), President of
Queen’s College, Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity, Cambridge, Lord
Bishop of Salisbury. By the Rev. Morris Fuller, B.D., Vicar of St.
Mark’s, Marylebone. _Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d._

  Dr. Davenant, Bishop of Salisbury, the maternal uncle of Dr. Fuller,
  lived at a very critical time in our history (1571-1641). He was one
  of the British representatives of the first great Synod of the
  reformed churches held at Dort, was one of Archbishop Laud’s
  Suffragans, and assisted him in carrying out his reforms.

  Précis is given of some of the Bishop’s writings, and a very
  celebrated sermon, never before published and supposed to have been
  lost, is printed _in extenso_.

                              DAVID HANNAY

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ROYAL NAVY, From Early Times to the Present Day.
By David Hannay. Illustrated. _2 Vols. Demy 8vo. 15s._

  This book aims at giving an account not only of the fighting we have
  done at sea, but of the growth of the service, of the part the Navy
  has played in the development of the Empire, and of its inner life.
  The author has endeavoured to avoid the mistake of sacrificing the
  earlier periods of naval history—the very interesting wars with
  Holland in the seventeenth century, for instance, or the American War
  of 1779-1783—to the later struggle with Revolutionary and Imperial
  France.


                            COL. COOPER KING

THE STORY OF THE BRITISH ARMY. By Lieut.-Colonel Cooper King, of the
Staff College, Camberley. Illustrated. _Demy 8vo. 7s. 6d._

  This volume aims at describing the nature of the different armies that
  have been formed in Great Britain, and how from the early and feudal
  levies the present standing army came to be. The changes in tactics,
  uniform, and armament are briefly touched upon, and the campaigns in
  which the army has shared have been so far followed as to explain the
  part played by British regiments in them.

  volumes of which will be edited by competent scholars, printed in

  sufficient guarantee of the excellence of the edition.

                       Methuen’s Classical Texts

                             GENERAL EDITOR
                          E. C. MARCHANT, M.A.
OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD; FELLOW OF PETERHOUSE, CAMBRIDGE; ST. PAUL’s
                            SCHOOL, LONDON.

Messrs. Methuen propose to issue a new series of Classical Texts, edited
by eminent scholars, for the use of English-speaking students. The books
will be well printed and bound, and will be published at a very low
price. The first volume of every author will contain a brief
Introduction in English, not exceeding eight pages, in which the
necessary information about the MSS. will be given, and the salient
features of the author’s style indicated.

The critical notes, which will be at the foot of the page, will exhibit
only the important MS. variants and conjectures of special value. They
will contain very little argument; and there will be no explanatory
notes. Every volume of the series will contain a short _Index Rerum et
Nominum_.

Special attention will be paid to the typography of the series.

The following, among many others, are arranged:—

                       Methuen’s Byzantine Texts

                             GENERAL EDITOR
                            J. B. BURY, M.A.
    FELLOW AND TUTOR OF TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN, PROFESSOR OF MODERN
                     HISTORY IN DUBLIN UNIVERSITY.

Messrs. Methuen propose to issue a series of texts of Byzantine
Historians, edited by English and foreign scholars. It will consist
mainly of Greek texts, but will also include English translations of
some Oriental works which are important sources for Byzantine history.
The Greek texts, which will be in all cases based on original study of
MSS., will be accompanied by brief critical notes, and preceded by short
introductions, containing the necessary explanations as to the material
which has been used for the determination of the text. A special feature
of these volumes will be very full _indices Graecitatis_, framed with a
view to the collection of material for the _Lexicon totius Graecitatis_
of the future. Each volume will of course also be provided with an
_Index Rerum et Nominum_.

The collaboration of a considerable number of eminent foreign scholars
has been secured; so that this series can justly claim to be regarded as
international.

  which Mr. Kipling has built the whole of his work.’—_Times._

  ‘Full of passionate patriotism and the Imperial spirit.’—_Yorkshire
  Post._

  ‘The Empire has found a singer; it is no depreciation of the songs to
  say that statesmen may have, one way or other, to take account of
  them.’—_Manchester Guardian._

  ‘Animated through and through with indubitable genius.’—_Daily
  Telegraph._

  ‘Packed with inspiration, with humour, with pathos.’—_Daily
  Chronicle._

  ‘All the pride of empire, all the intoxication of power, all the
  ardour, the energy, the masterful strength and the wonderful endurance
  and death-scorning pluck which are the very bone and fibre and marrow
  of the British character are here.’—_Daily Mail._

Rudyard Kipling. BARRACK-ROOM BALLADS; And Other Verses. By Rudyard
Kipling. _Tenth Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s._

  ‘Mr. Kipling’s verse is strong, vivid, full of character....
  Unmistakable genius rings in every line.’—_Times._

  ‘The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We
  read them with laughter and tears; the metres throb in our pulses, the
  cunningly ordered words tingle with life; and if this be not poetry,
  what is?’—_Pall Mall Gazette._

“Q.” POEMS AND BALLADS. By “Q.,” Author of ‘Green Bays,’ etc. _Crown

8vo. 3s. 6d._

  ‘An attractive and catholic selection.’—_Times._

  ‘It is edited by the most original and most accomplished of modern
  Irish poets, and against his editing but a single objection can be
  brought, namely, that it excludes from the collection his own delicate
  lyrics.’—_Saturday Review._

E. Mackay. A SONG OF THE SEA: My Lady of Dreams, and other Poems. By
Eric Mackay, Author of ‘The Love Letters of a Violinist.’ _Second
Edition. Fcap. 8vo, gilt top. 5s._

  sonorous.’—_Globe._

Ibsen. BRAND. A Drama by Henrik Ibsen. Translated by William Wilson.
_Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 3s. 6d._

  Brave” are intended to suit the real tastes of boys, and will suit the
  taste of the great majority.’—_Spectator._

  critical and textual, a critical and biographical Introduction, and a
  Glossary.

  ‘Among the editions in one volume, Mr. Andrew Lang’s will take the
  place of authority.’—_Times._

  ‘To the general public the beauty of its type, and the fair
  proportions of its pages, as well as the excellent chronological
  arrangement of the poems, should make it acceptable enough.  Mr. Lang
  and his publishers have certainly succeeded in producing an attractive
  popular edition of the poet, in which the brightly written
  biographical introduction is not the least notable feature.’—_Glasgow
  Herald._

                        Edited by W. E. Henley.

  phrase that might be applied to them.’—_Globe._

  size, and pleasant to look upon, so that whether on the shelf, or on
  the table, or in the hand the possessor is thoroughly content with
  them.’—_Guardian._

Edition. Crown 8vo. Buckram. 6s._

  overmuch.’—_Saturday Review._

Baring Gould. With Numerous Illustrations by F. D. Bedford. _Second

  to the number of 77, game-rhymes, and jingles. To the student we
  commend the sensible introduction, and the explanatory notes. The

  pleasure to touch; and the borders and pictures are among the very
  best specimens we have seen of the Gaskin school.’—_Birmingham
  Gazette._

M.A., and Illustrated by Walter Crane. _Crown 8vo, gilt top. 5s._

  A collection of the best verse inspired by the birth of Christ from
  the Middle Ages to the present day. A distinction of the book is the
  large number of poems it contains by modern authors, a few of which
  are here printed for the first time.

  ‘An anthology which, from its unity of aim and high poetic excellence,
  has a better right to exist than most of its fellows.’—_Guardian._

Gilt top. 8s. 6d. each. Also crown 8vo. 6s. each. Vols. I. and II._

  ‘The time has certainly arrived for a new edition of Gibbon’s great
  work.... Professor Bury is the right man to undertake this task. His
  learning is amazing, both in extent and accuracy. The book is issued
  in a handy form, and at a moderate price, and it is admirably
  printed.’—_Times._

  ‘The edition is edited as a classic should be edited, removing
  nothing, yet indicating the value of the text, and bringing it up to
  date. It promises to be of the utmost value, and will be a welcome
  addition to many libraries.’—_Scotsman._

  ‘This edition, so far as one may judge from the first instalment, is a
  marvel of erudition and critical skill, and it is the very minimum of
  praise to predict that the seven volumes of it will supersede Dean
  Milman’s as the standard edition of our great historical
  classic.’—_Glasgow Herald._

  ‘The beau-ideal Gibbon has arrived at last.’—_Sketch._

  ‘At last there is an adequate modern edition of Gibbon.... The best
  edition the nineteenth century could produce.’—_Manchester Guardian._

  accomplished student of comparative archæology. In these lectures,

  with rare skill in elucidating the development of decorative art in
  Egypt, and in tracing its influence on the art of other
  countries.’—_Times._

Cameos, etc. By S. Baring Gould, Author of ‘Mehalah,’ etc. _Fourth
Edition. Royal 8vo. 15s._

  ‘A most splendid and fascinating book on a subject of undying
  interest. The great feature of the book is the use the author has made
  of the existing portraits of the Caesars, and the admirable critical
  subtlety he has exhibited in dealing with this line of research. It is
  brilliantly written, and the illustrations are supplied on a scale of
  profuse magnificence.’—_Daily Chronicle._

  ‘The volumes will in no sense disappoint the general reader. Indeed,
  in their way, there is nothing in any sense so good in English.... Mr.
  Baring Gould has presented his narrative in such a way as not to make
  one dull page.’—_Athenæum._

  main facts of English Social and Industrial History placed in due
  perspective. Beginning with prehistoric times, it passes in review the

  place before his readers the history of industry as a connected whole

  illustrated by Maps, Diagrams, and Tables, and aided by copious
  Footnotes.

                               Biography

S. Baring Gould. THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. By S. Baring Gould.
With over 450 Illustrations in the Text and 13 Photogravure Plates.
_Large quarto. Gilt top. 36s._

  ‘A brilliant and attractive volume. It impresses first by reason of
  its bulk, and next by reason of its substantial and striking binding.
  Within, it is remarkable, to begin with, for the considerable number
  and unusual excellence of its illustrations. Never before, it is safe
  to say, have so many pictures relating to Napoleon been brought
  together within the limits of an English book. The portraits alone are
  multitudinous; Bonaparte is presented to us at all ages, in all sorts
  of costume, and amid very varied circumstances. Then there are
  reproductions of statuettes, busts, and medals, caricatures, portraits
  of his connections by birth and marriage, representations of events in
  which he took part, and what not. The list of illustrations in the
  text covers nine pages, and in addition there are a dozen full-page
  photogravures, in which famous paintings are reproduced. Altogether,
  this is a table-book of the first class. But it is more. It embodies
  “a study of the character and opinions of Napoleon” on which Mr.
  Baring Gould can be freely congratulated. The writer’s plan has been
  to “lay on one side what concerned Napoleon’s military achievements
  and the political importance of his life, so far as did not bear on
  the development of his mind and the movements of his heart.” By this
  means a novel point of view has been secured, and the result is a
  narrative of which the chief characteristic is an agreeable
  freshness.’—_Globe._

R. L. Stevenson. VAILIMA LETTERS. By Robert Louis Stevenson. With an
Etched Portrait by William Strang, and other Illustrations. _Second
Edition. Crown 8vo. Buckram. 7s. 6d._

  ‘The Vailima Letters are rich in all the varieties of that charm which
  have secured for Stevenson the affection of many others besides
  “journalists, fellow-novelists, and boys.”’—_The Times._

  ‘Few publications have in our time been more eagerly awaited than
  these “Vailima Letters,” giving the first fruits of the correspondence
  of Robert Louis Stevenson. But, high as the tide of expectation has
  run, no reader can possibly be disappointed in the result.’—_St.
  James’s Gazette._

  ‘For the student of English literature these letters indeed are a
  treasure. They are more like “Scott’s Journal” in kind than any other
  literary autobiography.’—_National Observer._

Victor Hugo. THE LETTERS OF VICTOR HUGO. Translated from the French by
F. Clarke, M.A. _In Two Volumes. Demy 8vo. 10s. 6d. each. Vol. I.
1815-35._

  This is the first volume of one of the most interesting and important
  collection of letters ever published in France. The correspondence
  dates from Victor Hugo’s boyhood to his death, and none of the letters
  have been published before. The arrangement is chiefly chronological,
  but where there is an interesting set of letters to one person these
  are arranged together. The first volume contains, among others, (1)
  Letters to his father; (2) to his young wife; (3) to his confessor,
  Lamennais; (4) a very important set of about fifty letters to
  Sainte-Beuve; (5) letters about his early books and plays.

  ‘A charming and vivid picture of a man whose egotism never marred his
  natural kindness, and whose vanity did not impair his
  greatness.’—_Standard._

J. M. Rigg. ST. ANSELM OF CANTERBURY: A Chapter in the History of
Religion. By J. M. Rigg, of Lincoln’s Inn, Barrister-at-Law. _Demy 8vo.
7s. 6d._

  This work gives for the first time in moderate compass a complete
  portrait of St. Anselm, exhibiting him in his intimate and interior as
  well as in his public life. Thus, while the great
  ecclesiastico-political struggle in which he played so prominent a
  part is fully dealt with, unusual prominence is given to the profound
  and subtle speculations by which he permanently influenced theological
  and metaphysical thought; while it will be a surprise to most readers
  to find him also appearing as the author of some of the most exquisite
  religious poetry in the Latin language.

  ‘Mr. Rigg has told the story of the great Primate’s life with
  scholarly ability, and has thereby contributed an interesting chapter
  to the history of the Norman period.’—_Daily Chronicle._

F. W. Joyce. THE LIFE OF SIR FREDERICK GORE OUSELEY. By F. W. Joyce,
M.A. With Portraits and Illustrations. _Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d._

  ‘The book gives us a complete picture of the life of one who will ever
  be held in loving remembrance, and who in the history of music in this
  country will always occupy a prominent position on account of the many
  services he rendered to the art.’—_Musical News._

  ‘This book has been undertaken in quite the right spirit, and written
  with sympathy, insight, and considerable literary skill.’—_Times._

W. G. Collingwood. THE LIFE OF JOHN RUSKIN. By W. G. Collingwood, M.A.,
Editor of Mr. Ruskin’s Poems. With numerous Portraits, and 13 Drawings
by Mr. Ruskin. _Second Edition. 2 vols. 8vo. 32s._

  ‘No more magnificent volumes have been published for a long
  time.’—_Times._

  ‘It is long since we had a biography with such delights of substance
  and of form. Such a book is a pleasure for the day, and a joy for
  ever.’—_Daily Chronicle._

C. Waldstein. JOHN RUSKIN: a Study. By Charles Waldstein, M.A., Fellow
of King’s College, Cambridge. With a Photogravure Portrait after
Professor Herkomer. _Post 8vo. 5s._

  ‘A thoughtful, impartial, well-written criticism of Ruskin’s teaching,
  intended to separate what the author regards as valuable and permanent
  from what is transient and erroneous in the great master’s
  writing.’—_Daily Chronicle._

W. H. Hutton. THE LIFE OF SIR THOMAS MORE. By W. H. Hutton, M.A., Author
of ‘William Laud.’ _With Portraits. Crown 8vo. 5s._

BARABBAS: A DREAM OF THE WORLD’S TRAGEDY. _Twenty-ninth Edition._

  ‘The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative beauty of
  the writing have reconciled us to the daring of the conception, and
  the conviction is forced on us that even so exalted a subject cannot
  be made too familiar to us, provided it be presented in the true
  spirit of Christian faith. The amplifications of the Scripture
  narrative are often conceived with high poetic insight, and this
  “Dream of the World’s Tragedy” is, despite some trifling
  incongruities, a lofty and not inadequate paraphrase of the supreme
  climax of the inspired narrative.’—_Dublin Review._

THE SORROWS OF SATAN. _Thirty-fourth Edition._

  ‘A very powerful piece of work.... The conception is magnificent, and
  is likely to win an abiding place within the memory of man.... The
  author has immense command of language, and a limitless audacity....
  This interesting and remarkable romance will live long after much of
  the ephemeral literature of the day is forgotten.... A literary
  phenomenon ... novel, and even sublime.’—W. T. Stead in the _Review of
  Reviews_.

                         _Crown 8vo. 6s. each._

THE GOD IN THE CAR. _Seventh Edition._

  ‘A very remarkable book, deserving of critical analysis impossible
  within our limit; brilliant, but not superficial; well considered, but
  not elaborated; constructed with the proverbial art that conceals, but
  yet allows itself to be enjoyed by readers to whom fine literary
  method is a keen pleasure.’—_The World._

A CHANGE OF AIR. _Fourth Edition._

  ‘A graceful, vivacious comedy, true to human nature. The characters
  are traced with a masterly hand.’—_Times._

A MAN OF MARK. _Fourth Edition._

  foe.’—_Guardian._

                         _Crown 8vo. 6s. each._

  ‘To say that a book is by the author of “Mehalah” is to imply that it
  contains a story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic
  possibilities, vivid and sympathetic descriptions of Nature, and a
  wealth of ingenious imagery.’—_Speaker._

  ‘That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a
  conclusion that may be very generally accepted. His views of life are
  fresh and vigorous, his language pointed and characteristic, the
  incidents of which he makes use are striking and original, his
  characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional people, are
  drawn and coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his
  descriptions of scenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes
  and skilled hands of a master of his art, that he is always fresh and
  never dull, and under such conditions it is no wonder that readers
  have gained confidence both in his power of amusing and satisfying
  them, and that year by year his popularity widens.’—_Court Circular._

  delicate touch and innate sympathy with humanity.’—_Pall Mall
  Gazette._

  Parker to be congratulated on the finest novel he has yet
  written.’—_Athenæum._

  ‘Mr. Parker’s latest book places him in the front rank of living
  novelists. “The Seats of the Mighty” is a great book.’—_Black and
  White._

  ‘One of the strongest stories of historical interest and adventure
  that we have read for many a day.... A notable and successful
  book.’—_Speaker._

  ‘An admirable romance. The glory of a romance is its plot, and this
  plot is crowded with fine sensations, which have no rest until the
  fall of the famous old city and the final restitution of love.’—_Pall
  Mall Gazette._

  haled along. An inspiration of “manliness and courage.”’—_Daily

  dramatic.’—_Globe._

  ‘There is no keener pleasure in life than the recognition of genius.
  Good work is commoner than it used to be, but the best is as rare as
  ever. All the more gladly, therefore, do we welcome in “Maelcho” a
  piece of work of the first order, which we do not hesitate to describe
  as one of the most remarkable literary achievements of this
  generation. Miss Lawless is possessed of the very essence of
  historical genius.’—_Manchester Guardian._

  Review._

  true humanity of the book lies its justification, the permanence of
  its interest, and its indubitable triumph.’—_Athenæum._

  ‘A great book. The author’s method is amazingly effective, and
  produces a thrilling sense of reality. The writer lays upon us a
  master hand. The book is simply appalling and irresistible in its

  mark it is certain to make.’—_World._

J. Maclaren Cobban. THE KING OF ANDAMAN: A Saviour of Society. By J.
Maclaren Cobban. _Crown 8vo. 6s._

  ‘An unquestionably interesting book. It would not surprise us if it
  turns out to be the most interesting novel of the season, for it
  contains one character, at least, who has in him the root of
  immortality, and the book itself is ever exhaling the sweet savour of
  the unexpected.... Plot is forgotten and incident fades, and only the
  really human endures, and throughout this book there stands out in
  bold and beautiful relief its high-souled and chivalric protagonist,
  James the Master of Hutcheon, the King of Andaman himself.’—_Pall Mall
  Gazette._

H. Morrah. A SERIOUS COMEDY. By Herbert Morrah. _Crown 8vo. 6s._
